# New horizons pack(Test version)
At the moment,there are no caves, villages and other structures in the package. They will be added as soon as I finish building them

Pack for the [Iris](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-world-gen-custom-biome-colors.84586/). This package has some performance issues. But then the biomes would not look as I expected(It seems to be a small sacrifice). Therefore, use the pregen. If you have any ideas or suggestions, you can dm me in Discord(K530#4335).

Todo list:
- Add Caves(wip)
- More different structures/dungeons
- More different regions and biomes
- Rework villages(Which are not present)
- Various effects in certain biomes(wip)
- Oceans
- Correct distribution of biomes and regions
